# classification-toolkit
A modular PyTorch pipeline for training and evaluating image classifiers with nested cross-validation, early stopping, and hyperparameter optimization.

## TODO:
- Classification ensemble through bagging
- Simple holdout classification (train-val-test training and validation)
